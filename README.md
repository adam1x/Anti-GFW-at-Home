# Anti-GFW-at-Home
Stuff used on my home network to counter GFW.

+ AcrylicConfiguration.ini: [Acrylic DNS Proxy](http://mayakron.altervista.org/wikibase/show.php?id=AcrylicHome) config file
+ dnsmasq.conf: [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) config file
+ SwitchyOmega options.bak: Exported options for [SwitchyOmega](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif?hl=en), a Chrome extension to automatically load URLs through proxy based on user rules.
+ tor_home.pac: [Proxy auto-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config) file used to direct some net traffic through a Tor proxy on my laptop

Note that I took out a private DNS server's address and all of my hosts entries from these files.
